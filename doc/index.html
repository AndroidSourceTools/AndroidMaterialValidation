                 <p>The aim of this documentation is to offer an overview of the project's source code and to explain, how the interface, which is provided by the library, can be used and how the underlying implementations are supposed to work.</p>            

                <p>The library provides the following features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The library provides a custom <tt>EditText</tt> implementation, which can be validated according to the Material Design guidelines.</li>
                    <li>The library provides a custom <tt>EditText</tt> implementation, which can not only be validated according to the Material Design guidelines, but also allows to visualize the password strength, depending on customizable constraints.</li>
                    <li>The library provides a custom Spinner implementation, which can be validated according to the Material Design guidelines.</li>
                    <li>The library includes a large number of pre-defined validators, for example for validating phone numbers, e-mail addresses, domain names etc.</li>
                </ul>
